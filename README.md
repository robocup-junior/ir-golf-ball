Shells are 3D printed, after lot of testing we found out that best option in general is using [PCTG](https://shop.spectrumfilaments.com/product-eng-1414-Filament-Spectrum-Premium-PCTG-1-75mm-PURE-ORANGE-1kg-RAL-2004.html) for good optical properties/cheap/easy to print/mechanical properties similar to PC

For magnets we are using [2mm*5mm](https://www.unimagnet.cz/neodymovy-magnet-kotouc-5-mm-v-2-mm-sila-650-g_z55/) N42 neodimium magnets
